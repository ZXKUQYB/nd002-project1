# Explore Weather Trends

This is a personal project which takes collected worldwide temperature data and analyze the trends of global weather.

### Instructions

You would need to download both the [Jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/ZXKUQYB/nd002-project1/blob/main/Explore_Weather_Trends.ipynb), and all the CSV files in the [data](https://github.com/ZXKUQYB/nd002-project1/tree/main/data) directory to run the program code.

To setup a test run of the program code in notebook, it is recommended to use a temporary Jupyter server offered by [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try). Be sure to choose **JupyterLab** when you get your temporary Jupyter server, since it comes with all the Python modules needed for this project already installed. Just upload the downloaded files to your temporary workspace and give it a run.

Alternatively, you can also run it in your own local environment if you prefer, but the instructions to configure a local environment will not be covered here.

### Additional Information

There are also two supplemental document files in this repo. While the PDF file is a summary report of the project, the HTML file is simply a soft copy of the Jupyter notebook file created by using [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io), and there are some ways for you to [preview its contents](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8446218/how-to-see-an-html-page-on-github-as-a-normal-rendered-html-page-to-see-preview) online at ease if you want.
